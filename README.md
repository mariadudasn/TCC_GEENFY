<h2>Project Planning</h2>

<div align="justify">
📅The project developed by the team aims to automate the process of issuing identification cards for students enrolled in FIC courses (Initial and Continuing Training) at the SENAI Jundiaí unit. Currently, this responsibility falls to the institution's administrative office, and the task is performed entirely manually. This procedure, in addition to being repetitive, requires a considerable amount of the staff's time, negatively impacting the performance of other activities and compromising the office's operational efficiency.

Every 15 days, new FIC course classes are formed, with an average of 20 students enrolled per class. The current process requires staff to issue each student's identification card individually, which is time-consuming and prone to operational errors.

Given these challenges, the team proposed the development of an automation solution based on RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to optimize the card issuance process. This automated solution aims not only to reduce the time spent on this task but also to improve the administrative workflow, allowing staff to focus on other responsibilities.

The automation was implemented through a web application, which serves as the entry point for the process. Staff responsibilities will be simplified to uploading a file containing the new students' data, from which the automated system will efficiently and accurately generate the identification cards.

This solution, therefore, seeks to enhance agility, reduce errors, and free up the institution's staff for more strategic activities, ultimately increasing the overall productivity of the administrative office.

It allows for the creation of processes, as well as communication with them and retrieving their results. Thus, subprocess offers a flexible and robust way to execute system commands directly from your script, replacing older functions like os.system().

One of the main advantages of the subprocess library is its ability to capture the output of executed commands, allowing you to process the results directly in your code. Additionally, it offers greater control over processes, allowing for the redirection of input, output, and error streams, as well as safer and more efficient management of subprocesses.

The subprocess module also allows commands to be executed in different environments, such as Shell, using the shell=True option, although this option should be used with caution due to potential security risks. In general, the use of the library is recommended for situations where it is necessary to call external programs, perform administrative task automations, or integrate Python scripts with other system applications and utilities.</p>
			<li id="Threading"><b>Threading</b></li>
			</br>
			<p align="justify">
The threading library in Python is a powerful tool for performing multitasking, allowing the simultaneous execution of multiple operations within a single program. This concept is known as multithreading, where the code is split into multiple "threads" that can run in parallel. Each thread functions as an independent unit of execution, allowing different parts of the code to run at the same time, which can lead to significant performance gains, especially in tasks involving I/O operations (such as file reading, data downloading, or API calls).

In simple terms, it is a way to execute multiple operations simultaneously. For example, if you have several tasks that can run independently — like downloading files, processing information, or making HTTP requests — the threading library allows you to run these tasks in parallel. This means that instead of waiting for one function to finish before starting another, you can execute all of them at the same time, increasing efficiency and speeding up the execution of your program.

Using the threading library can significantly improve the performance of your code, especially in situations where multiple tasks do not depend on one another. However, it is important to be cautious when using threads, as simultaneous execution can introduce complexities, such as race conditions and synchronization issues between threads, which need to be properly managed to avoid unexpected bugs.</p>
			<li id="Pathlib"><b>Pathlib</b></li>
			</br>
			<p align="justify">
The pathlib library is a module introduced in Python 3 that provides a modern and efficient way to handle file and directory paths in a way that is independent of the operating system. Unlike the traditional os.path module, which is also used for handling paths, pathlib offers an object-oriented interface that is more intuitive and readable, making it easier to work with files and directories.

One of the main benefits of pathlib is its ability to handle paths independently of the operating system. For example, on Unix-based systems (such as macOS and Linux), a file path might be represented as /Users/sammy/ocean/wave.txt, while on Windows, the same file might have the path C:\\Users\\sammy\\ocean\\wave.txt. With pathlib, you can manipulate these paths without worrying about the differences in formatting, as it abstracts these variations, making the code more portable.

The pathlib library is particularly useful in operations involving the creation, movement, and listing of files and directories. For example, it is possible to list all files with a specific extension in a directory, create new directories, or navigate through different folder levels in a simple manner. Using pathlib results in more readable and concise code, reducing the need for complex functions and improving clarity.

In addition to basic functionalities such as checking for file existence, retrieving attributes, and creating paths, pathlib also includes advanced utilities, such as using glob patterns to find files that match a specific pattern (*.txt, for example) and methods for efficiently traversing directory hierarchies.</p>

The agile methodology *Scrum* proposes the organized and efficient collaboration of all project members, with the goal of delivering a high-quality product incrementally. *Scrum* is ideal for dynamic and complex environments, where requirements can change quickly, and flexibility is needed to adapt to new demands. It is based on a set of roles, events, and artifacts that facilitate agile development.

Kanban is a visual workflow management methodology, widely used in environments that require agility and efficiency, such as software development, industrial production, and even project management. Its primary goal is to optimize the workflow, allowing teams to visualize task progress and identify bottlenecks, promoting continuous improvement.

Visualization occurs through a Kanban board, which is divided into columns, each representing different stages of the process. These columns, commonly labeled as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done," reflect the current state of tasks. Each task is represented by a card, which contains important information such as the task description, the person responsible for the project, deadlines, and, in some cases, priority and complexity.

Additionally, Kanban encourages the use of Work In Progress (WIP) limits, which helps prevent the accumulation of tasks in a single stage, maintaining a continuous and balanced flow. Another key point is adaptability: Kanban can be easily adjusted to meet the specific needs of different teams and departments, allowing organizations to evolve and optimize their processes in an agile manner.

   <b>How Do These Tables Work Together?</b>
  </br></br>
  <p align="justify">These tables interact with each other to ensure the system operates efficiently. Login data is managed by one part of the system (the auth_user table and user groups), while other functionalities, such as student registration, file submission, and class management, are handled by the specific tables.

For example:
<ul>
	<li align="justify">When a user logs in, the system checks the auth_user table to verify their existence and ensure the credentials are correct.</li>
	<li align="justify">After logging in, the user can access documents, view classes, or edit their profile by interacting with tables such as geenfy_cadastro, geenfy_novaturma, and geenfy_perfil.</li>
	<li align="justify">The organization and control of files (in progress or completed) are managed by the geenfy_finished_file and geenfy_in_progress_file tables.</li>
</ul>
