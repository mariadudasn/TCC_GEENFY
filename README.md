<h2>Project Planning</h2>

<div align="justify">
üìÖThe project developed by the team aims to automate the process of issuing identification cards for students enrolled in FIC courses (Initial and Continuing Training) at the SENAI Jundia√≠ unit. Currently, this responsibility falls to the institution's administrative office, and the task is performed entirely manually. This procedure, in addition to being repetitive, requires a considerable amount of the staff's time, negatively impacting the performance of other activities and compromising the office's operational efficiency.

Every 15 days, new FIC course classes are formed, with an average of 20 students enrolled per class. The current process requires staff to issue each student's identification card individually, which is time-consuming and prone to operational errors.

Given these challenges, the team proposed the development of an automation solution based on RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to optimize the card issuance process. This automated solution aims not only to reduce the time spent on this task but also to improve the administrative workflow, allowing staff to focus on other responsibilities.

The automation was implemented through a web application, which serves as the entry point for the process. Staff responsibilities will be simplified to uploading a file containing the new students' data, from which the automated system will efficiently and accurately generate the identification cards.

This solution, therefore, seeks to enhance agility, reduce errors, and free up the institution's staff for more strategic activities, ultimately increasing the overall productivity of the administrative office.

	<li><b>Markup Language<b></li>
 </br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>HTML5</b></li>
			</br>
			<p align="justify">
HTML (*HyperText Markup Language*) is a markup language for the web used to structure and organize the content of internet pages. With a variety of *tags*, developers can define how different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and links, will be displayed in browsers. This language is widely recognized as the standard for building virtually all websites we access, playing a fundamental role in presenting all the elements that make up a page in a coherent manner.

One of HTML's greatest advantages is its compatibility. Any browser, on any device‚Äîwhether a computer or a smartphone‚Äîcan interpret and correctly display an HTML-based page. This means that regardless of where you are or what you‚Äôre using, the content will be accessible.

Moreover, HTML stands out for its flexibility, as it easily integrates with other technologies such as CSS (*Cascading Style Sheets*) and JavaScript. CSS helps style the appearance of pages by defining colors, fonts, and layouts, while JavaScript adds interactivity, making pages more dynamic for users.

Another essential aspect of HTML is accessibility. When used correctly, with semantic elements and proper attributes, HTML ensures that screen readers and other assistive devices can effectively interpret the content. This is crucial for making web pages more inclusive for people with visual impairments or other special needs.

In summary, HTML is a markup language that serves as the foundation for building websites and integrates seamlessly with other technologies. Its ability to promote accessibility and compatibility across various platforms makes HTML an essential tool for developers and designers, helping them create effective and accessible web experiences for everyone.</p>
			<li><b>CSS3</b></li>
			</br>
			<p align="justify">
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a design language used to style web pages structured with markup languages like HTML. It allows developers to define colors, sizes, shapes, spacing, fonts, and various other visual aspects, creating a unique look for websites. Beyond enhancing design, CSS enables control over a page's responsiveness‚Äîits ability to adapt to different screen sizes‚Äîensuring a seamless experience across devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers.

When it comes to responsiveness, CSS plays a vital role in making web pages accessible. Using techniques like media queries, developers can create layouts that adjust dynamically to different devices and screen resolutions. This is crucial for providing a consistent and enjoyable browsing experience, regardless of the device being used.

CSS can be implemented in several ways. The most common method is creating a separate file (.css) linked to the HTML file, keeping structure and design neatly organized. Alternatively, CSS can be written directly within the HTML file, either in a <style> tag in the page's head or by applying styles directly to each HTML element using the style attribute.

In addition to styling colors and fonts, CSS enables the creation of animations, transitions, and visual effects, making navigation smoother and more engaging. It also integrates seamlessly with design frameworks and component libraries like Bootstrap, which speed up development and help create standardized, polished interfaces.

With its versatility and power, CSS not only shapes the visual appeal of a website but also ensures it is functional and accessible, catering to diverse user needs and expectations.</p>
